With quick thinking, you raise your new found shield and block the hit. Counter attacking you drive your walkers free arm straight into the chest of the beast, grabbing hold of the intermingled computer and beating heart. Pulling back, you pull it out, causing the rouge walker to scream in agony. It falls to the ground and you can hear, with it\"s last breathe, \"Thank you.\" before it dies in front of you.

All of a sudden the ground starts to shake and you hear loud clanking and booming heading straight for you. You turn around and see the massive mechanical beast of a walker running towards you. It\"s a twisted mess of grown flesh and machine. A big cannon on the one arm and a claw on the other. Glowing red eyes and steel for teeth. It\"ll soon be upon you. Do you have everything you need?
