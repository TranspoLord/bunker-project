It swings back around and hits you.\n With quick thinking, you raise your new found shield and block the hit. Counter attacking\n you drive your walkers free arm straight into the chest of the beast, grabbing hold\n of the intermingled computer and beating heart.

All of a sudden\n the ground starts to shake and you hear loud clanking and booming heading straight\n for you. You turn around and see the massive mechanical beast of a walker running\n towards you. It\"s a twisted mess of grown flesh and machine. A big cannon on the\n one arm and a claw on the other. Glowing red eyes and steel for teeth. It\"ll soon\n be upon you. Do you have everything you need? (Type Fight)"
